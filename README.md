## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Quary
- CSS flex
- CSS grid

### What I learned

What I learnt from this project was making use of "clip-path" for the time in cropping out the left side of the computer image, and also knowing all its properties.

### Continued development
I'll like to know better ways to add a hover state on an image element without making use of position.
